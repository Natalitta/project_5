## SEO
Search Engine Optimization was implemented in several ways:

### Keywords
There was a research conducted to find the best keywords using Wordstream (https://www.wordstream.com/keywords). 

<img src="media/docs/keywords.jpg">

* The keywords were added to the meta tag in the head of the base template of the app.
* Also they were added to the content of the app, changed the h1 element from "New art courses are here" to "Online art courses to learn to paint are here" to include more keywords.

### Links

A rel attribute "noopener" was added to the social media links in the footer to tell search engines not to include them because they do not give any valuable information.

### Helpful files
There were 2 files created and added to the root of the app:
* sitemap.xml
* robots.txt
